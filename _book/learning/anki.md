Anki is *mainly* a tool for memorization (*and later, understanding*), not first-pass learning. 

## Decks

Input all cards into one deck with hierarchical tags (**Class**). Use two other decks for current sections and overall reviews (**Combined Current** and **Combined Review** respectively)

Having one review deck promotes interleaved practice while allowing you to prioritize current sections.
